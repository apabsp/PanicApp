A Windows app I made to quickly switch between environments. For example, if you wanna quickly switch from Gaming Mode, where you have Steam and games open, to a Study Mode.

Built with **.NET Framework** and **(WinForms)** in C#. Uses the `System.Diagnostics.Process` class to enumerate running processes. Lightweight and native to Windows.


## How to use
1. Click "Load Programs" to see what's currently running
2. Select programs you want to close and add them to the close list
3. Click the close button.
4. It's that simple!
